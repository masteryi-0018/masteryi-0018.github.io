permalink: /publication/2024-05-12
excerpt: 'The single-image super-resolution task benefits has a wide range of application scenarios, so has long been a hotspot in the field of computer vision. However, designing a continuous-scale super-resolution algorithm with excellent performance is still a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve this problem, we propose a continuous-scale SR algorithm based on a Transformer, which is called residual dense Swin Transformer (RDST). Firstly, we design a residual dense Transformer block (RDTB) to enhance the information flow before and after the network and extract local fusion features. Then, we use multilevel feature fusion to obtain richer feature information. Finally, we use the upsampling module based on the local implicit image function (LIIF) to obtain continuous-scale super-resolution results. We test RDST on multiple benchmarks. The experimental results show that RDST achieves SOTA performance in the fixed scale of super-resolution tasks in the distribution, and significantly improves (0.1∼0.6 dB) the arbitrary scale of super-resolution tasks out of distribution. Sufficient experiments show that our RDST can use fewer parameters, and its performance is better than the SOTA SR method.'
